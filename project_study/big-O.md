# Understanding the Big O Notations

**Algorithmic complexity made simple!!**

An algorithm’s performance depends on the number of steps it takes. Computer Scientists have borrowed the term 'Big-O Notataion' from the world of Mathematics to accurately describe an algorithm's effieciency.
Measuring an algorithm’s complexity is not a difficult concept to grasp — Although this sounds like an oxymoron — it is not!

**Big-O: Time complexxity**
* Big-O puts the `number of steps`(time complexity) in the spotlight and not the `run time`(space complexity - the hardware factor).
* An algorithm’s Big-O notation is determined by how it responds to different sizes of a given dataset. 
* The 'O' stands for `order of`.
* The Big-O notation takes a pessimistic approach to performance and refers to the worst case scenario.

## O(1) aka `constant time`
*  This means that the algorithm takes the same number of steps to execute regardless of how much data is passed in.

## O(N) 
* This is read as "Order of N"
* Interpreted as an approximation of the duration of the algorithm given N input elements.
* O(N) describes how many steps an algorithm takes based on the number of elements that it is acted upon.
