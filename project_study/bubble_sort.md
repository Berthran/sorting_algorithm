## Bubble Sort algorithm

The bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed until no swaps need to be performed.

Summary of bubble sort algorithmic operation
* Traverse an array until its sorted [A LOOP]
* Compares elements [A CONDITIONAL STATEMENT]
* Swap elements [AN OPERATION]

The terminating condition of the bubble sort algorithm is based on the idea that with each iteration, the largest unsorted number in the array is sorted (i.e it "bubbles" up to the top of the list, hence the name "bubble sort").
This is wonderfully illustrated [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif)
