### Running Time
============
The running time of an algorithm is how long it takes the algorithm to run.

Big O
The Big O is used to describe the running time of an algorithm. It focuses on the order on which the running time of an algorithm is. 
So, Big O simply means **on the order of**. 
Computer scientists tend to throw away constant factors and focus on the dominant factor. 
Within computer science and the analysis of algorithms these formulas are common
* O(n2)
* O(n log n)
* O(n)
* O(log n)
* O(1) 
where n refers a the number of steps the algorithms takes. While Big O refers to an upper bound of the running time, there's the omega notation that refers to a lower bound on the running time.
* Ω(n2)
* Ω(n log n)
* Ω(n)
* Ω(log n)
* Ω(1)
