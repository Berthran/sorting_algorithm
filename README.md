# Sorting Algorithms and Big O

This is a project on understanding the concepts of sorting algorithms and the big o notation. So, at the end of this project you should be able to explain to anyone:
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
